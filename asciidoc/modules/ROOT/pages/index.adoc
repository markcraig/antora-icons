= Some icons

== Fontawesome

The aim here is to get an empty check box.

In HTML, the following icon renders as a solid square.
It seems the Fontawesome solid icons are selected somehow.

In PDF, it renders as a "regular" outline square due to `icon-set: far` in the site settings.
That setting seems to have no effect in HTML.

++icon:square[]++: icon:square[]

== UTF-8

In HTML, the following character renders as an outline square with rounded edges.

In PDF, it renders as an outline rectangle, which means that it's not recognized as a character in the font used.

`\&#x25A2;`: &#x25A2;
